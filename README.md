## 🎯 What It Does

This app provides a suite of interactive tools for analyzing and experimenting with Just Intonation, including:

- Ratio input and simplification
- Prime factorization of pitch ratios
- Ratio lattice generator
- Visualization of tuning structures and their relationships

Whether you're studying microtonality, building custom tuning systems, or just curious about the inner workings of JI, this tool offers a hands-on way to explore.

## 🧭 How to Use

- Enter pitch ratios or prime limits to see their structure and interpretation
- Navigate through harmonic/subharmonic series using simple UI controls
- Use the lattice generator to visualize multidimensional tuning relationships
- Most tools are responsive, keyboard-friendly, and update in real time

Designed for composers, theorists, and students interested in tuning systems beyond 12-TET.

## 🔍 Technologies Used

- **React + JavaScript** frontend and **Python + Django** backend
- **CSS** for custom UI
- Hosted on **Netlify** and **Render**

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Built as a practical companion to music theory research in microtonality and Just Intonation. Inspired by historical systems and modern computational approaches to tuning.
